      <h2><u>Analyzing the effects of colonialism through the lenses of databases</u></h2>
  <P>Our database project aims to examine the lasting impact of colonialism on Africa, using relational, graph
    and spatial databases. Me and my partner explored major conflicts in Africa since decolonization and trace
     their roots to events that occurred during the colonial era. Through this, we demonstrated how these
      conflicts have affected the continent's economy, resources, and geopolitical relations, both historically
       and in the present day.
</P>
<p>
  Our project also compares the differences and similarities between relational and graph databases and
            evaluate their respective strengths and weaknesses in various scenarios. By providing insights into the
            suitability of each database type, we hope to contribute to the ongoing conversation about the best
            practices for data management and analysis.<br>
  Here is one of the many maps we made using spatial data and QGIS. This map shows the economy in relation to the number of years of conflict.

        <h2>Graph database (Neo4j)</h2>
  <p>Graph databases are designed to handle complex relationships between data entities, making them well-suited for scenarios where relationships are a
    key focus. Therefore, we used them to show different kinds of relationships between African countries, the conflicts,colonial powers, organizations and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example in this comprehensive graph representation, we present an intricate web of relationships
        that encapsulate the dynamic narrative of the First Congo War. Each node within the graph
        embodies a distinct entity, be it a Colony, Other Country, Organization, or the driving Causes
         behind the conflict. These entities come to life through carefully curated labels and properties,
       painting a vivid picture of the diverse actors involved in this historical event.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our graph visualization isn't just informative; it's designed for exploration.
        Users can delve deeper into specific aspects of the conflict, expand nodes of interest,
         and interact with the graph to uncover hidden details. A clear title and description provide context,
       while an intuitive legend deciphers the graph's visual language.

          <h2>Relational Database(MySQL)</h2>
          <p>Our relational database has 17 tables.By combining this tables we can get many valuable 
            information like how many people died in a specific conflict,how the economy of that country
             looks during each conflict, how many conflicts happened in British colonies, how many conflicts
              were caused over resource control and so on. We used relational databases to show numerical data
               because relational databases excel at organizing numerical data in structured tables with predefined
                schemas. This structure allows for efficient storage and retrieval of numerical values, making
                 them suitable for large datasets with well-defined data types.

        <h2>Example outcome from our relational database</h2>
        <p>Here is an example of what our relational database can do. This is an insight how the Rwandan genocide impacted the country's economy. The war started in 1994 so based on that, we viewed the economy of Rwanda a few years before and after the war. We can see that during 1994 the economy of Rwanda dropped by 50% showing how much the conflict affected the economy. Then It took them 5 years to get back to where they were.
